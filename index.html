            <h3>Hermitage Art Catalogs</h3>
            <p>From 2014 through 2017 I led a team of designers through the buildout and production of all product catalogs for Hermitage Art. Over the course of one year, we would produce two wholesale catalogs for Religious distributors and adapt them for a direct-to-church mailing, one in the Spring and Fall. In addition, a school products catalogs was made featuring different products for that market.</p>
            <p>Stylizations in each catalog were slightly different, varying in color choice, badges, and layouts. However, we were able to recycle similar assets such as font sizes, headline positioning, table layouts. I implemented subtle refinements over the years to the visual language to iterate on the design as we learned from each publication what worked and what didn’t from a visual standpoint. Lastly, I was able to strengthen our efficiency in the design process by creating automations and design standards that would save the company money by reducing errors and streamlining edits.</p>

          <h3>Learning for Life Eduction Guide</h3>
          <p>The goal of this guide was to share valuable information about the high level of education available through the Bolivar R~1 school district and to promote the community that supports its growth. I merged an attractive editorial page layout design with eye-catching imagery to invite readers to engage with the content and present the district in a professional and positive light.</p>
          <p>This document was created from scratch. I conducted research on editorial design to better understand best practices in layouts for story content. I sought to create a reproducible layout with consistent structure throughout. Being an earlier print work for me, I grew extensively in my ability to communicate with external resources, typeset, and color manage digital images.</p>

          <h3>Church Bulletins &amp; Typesetting</h3>
          <p>Customers of the Dexter Press Subscription Bulletin line were given the opportunity to order their bulletins with curated scripture verses on the back of their weekly designs. As lead designer of this product line, I assisted the team by selecting all of the verses to go on the back panels, and communicated typesetting instructions with the pre-press team. We presented our scriptures in one of three Bible translations: KJV, NIV, or NRSV depending on the customer type.</p>
          <p>I noticed early on that these scriptures were being placed in as block text with no breaks or styling applied. I wanted to improve the readability of this content by implementing typographic stylings that matched each translation's standards. For example, the NIV and NRSV uses a "poetic" linebreak style within Psalms, Proverbs, and several Minor Prophet passages to emphasize the scripture and better reflect meaning to contemporary readers. While KJV does not include the same typesetting features, it has a very uniform layout that should be followed with breaks for each new verse. Also, we needed to apply small caps for the word "Lord" when it is refering to the name of God, which occurs inconsistently throughout.</p>
          <p>Due to the complexity of scriptural typesetting, I helped craft powerful templates in InDesign to assist in the layout process. I also compiled a comprehensive guide to assist the pre-press team as they took on new design responsibility for this content piece.</p>

          <h3>Product Collateral Guides</h3>
          <p>A S Hospitality is a print provider for the Hospitality industry and has a history serving names like Hyatt, Marriott, IHG, Best Western, and Avendra. I assisted account managers in supplying clients with product collateral guides for various brands. While the goals of each guide varied slightly, they all showcased the current lineup of print products our company was producing for their brand. Some customers used this to help with new property onboarding.</p>
          <p>One challenge I had to overcome was the need to frequently update some of the guides, since items rotated in and out of circulation on a regular basis. The general solution was to use an intelligent Google Sheets spreadsheet for each project to control the layout of the content. The Google Sheet was programmed to generate a data merge .csv file that could be loaded into InDesign for compiling the contents of the document. This reduced errors while simultaneously decreasing the output time since there was less manual manipulation of the content.</p>

          <h3>Aloft Refuel Menu Boards</h3>
          <p>With the redesign of the Aloft Refuel Menu Boards, it became imperative to ensure implementation of the new layouts would not be too cumbersome for the pre-press team. Having handled the transition of the external agency's designs from Illustrator to InDesign, I understood the intended functionality of this custom item. Each property would have the opportunity to select which products show up where on their menu boards and at what price point they would be offered.</p>
          <p>The solution was a data capture form to generate an InDesign data merge file. the .csv would be loaded to the InDesign template and run in order to compile the property's posters according to the specifications set in the form. A video is linked below to show this functionality.</p>

              <p>The General Assembly Handbook project included the creation of an 80-page printed booklet in three translations.

          <p>In‐room dining menus are valuable touch points for independently branded and franchise hotel properties alike. The owners of The Kahler Grand Hotel understand that a high quality menu can enhance brand presence and raise the percieved value of a guest's visit. Boasting some of the finest dining experiences in Rochester, MN. — The Kahler sought to bring the cuisine of their premiere restaurant,The Lord Essex Steakhouse, to the guestroom.</p>
